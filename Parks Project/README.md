# Project 5 - *Parks*

Submitted by: **Aaliyah English**

**Parks** 

## 📖 Description

The Parks app is an iOS application built with **SwiftUI** that allows users to explore national parks across the United States. Using the **National Park Service (NPS) API**, the app fetches up-to-date information about parks, including images, descriptions, and location data.  

Users can browse a list of parks, tap on a park to view detailed information and a map of its location, and (with bonus features) filter by state, sort alphabetically, or search for a specific park. The app demonstrates modern SwiftUI practices, including **asynchronous data fetching with async/await**, **AsyncImage** for loading remote images, and dynamic SwiftUI views.


Time spent: **8** hours spent in total
